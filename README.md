This project involves analyzing the ICC World Cup 2023 data to evaluate player and team performance using various metrics. The focus was on identifying the best bowlers, batsmen, and all-rounders, both overall and by country. We introduced custom metrics, such as the combined bowling and batting score, to rank players based on their overall contributions.

Key analyses included:

Determining the best bowler, best batsman, and best all-rounder.
Ranking players by country for each of these metrics.
Analyzing country-wise contributions in terms of total runs and wickets.
Comparing the rankings of players and teams with the final points table to assess the relevance of our metrics.
The analysis confirmed that the metrics we created—particularly the all-rounder score and country-wise performance—correlate well with team success, supporting their relevance in evaluating player and team performance in the tournament.
